# KickStarter-SQL-Queries

A collection of SQL queries I wrote for preliminary analysis of Kickstarter campaign data downloaded from the _ks-data.sql_ file.

The analysis aimed to study and group kickstarter campaigns in multiple ways including:
* By final outcome
* By amounts pledged
* By toal number of backers
* By category
* By subcategory
* By campaign duration
* By backer location/nationality
